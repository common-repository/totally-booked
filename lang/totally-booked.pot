"            <strong>These options are meant for the power user and should be "
"used with caution. Adjusting the settings below will modify the core URL for "
"the sections generated by the plugin.</strong><br /><br />\n"
"\n"
"            This rewrite option is helpful for users who, for example, have "
"an existing books page and don't want that page overwritten by the plugin.  "
"In this case, you could enter something like \"mybooks\" in the \"Books "
"Archive Slug\" field below. This will ensure that any books you add through "
"TotallyBooked will only appear under the URL \"mybooks\", while any content "
"you have on a “books” page, will not be affected.<br /><br />\n"
"\n"
"            Your primary books page produced by TotallyBooked will then be "
"located at: %s instead of %s, and all the individual books pages created by "
"TotallyBooked will also appear under that “mybooks” heading.<br /><br />\n"
"\n"
"            We strongly recommend that you do NOT modify these values more "
"than once. Any modification once you’ve set them up the first time will "
"change the URLs for all your books pages.  This will break your original "
"links, and generate errors in the search engines.<br /><br />\n"
"\n"
"            If you must change these values, be sure to use a redirection "
"plugin, to 301 redirect the old book URLs to the new ones."

"We have coded the TotallyBooked plugin to be as compatible as possible with "
"most WordPress themes.  However, because there are thousands of themes, and "
"every theme is coded differently, our system may run into conflicts with "
"theme code once in awhile.<br /><br />\n"
"\n"
"            The extra compatibility options on this page will help you "
"integrate TotallyBooked with ANY theme, (even the one created by that web "
"guy who runs his office from the local bar and doesn’t respond to any of "
"your requests for updates!)<br /><br />\n"
"\n"
"            The two text boxes below represent the HTML before and after the "
"output generated by TotallyBooked. Using these boxes, you can tell "
"TotallyBooked where to display in your theme’s content area.<br /><br />\n"
"\n"
"            The code for these content areas is different for each theme.  "
"So, for example, if you are using the default WordPress theme (Twenty "
"Thirteen) you would put this in the \"Wrapper Start HTML\" text box:\n"
"            <pre>\n"
"    &lt;div id=\"primary\" class=\"site-content\"&gt;\n"
"        &lt;div id=\"content\" role=\"main\" class=\"entry-content "
"twentythirteen\"&gt;\n"
"            </pre>\n"
"\n"
"            and this in the \"Wrapper End HTML\" box:\n"
"            <pre>\n"
"        &lt;/div&gt;\n"
"    &lt;/div&gt;\n"
"            </pre>\n"
"\n"
"            Once you have the correct code in place, click the Save Options "
"button. (Or, if you’re comfortable modifying your site code directly, you "
"can skip this step and follow our <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/"
"totally-booked/other_notes/\">templating documentation</a> instead.)<br /"
"><br />\n"
"\n"
"            <strong>If you are not comfortable dealing with this level of "
"code, please ask someone who is qualified to help. Making a mistake here "
"will cause the pages generated by TotallyBooked to display in unpredictable "
"ways.</strong>\n"
